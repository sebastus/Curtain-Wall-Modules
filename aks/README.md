# Overview

This module deploys an AKS cluster with a default node pool. The AKS cluster:
-  uses Azure CNI networking
- has the KEDA workload_autoscaler_profile enabled
- creates and manages it's own managed identity
- is allowed to pull images from the Azure container registry
- Can add additional node pools via the node_pool variable

&nbsp;
# How to use

At the Curtain Wall modules level, run

`python codegen/src/main.py add -m aks -g {resource group name}`

&nbsp;
# Execution requirements

AKS is Linux only.

&nbsp;
# Changes you need to make

Once added to your environment, update the subnet used in the invocation script.

The AKS cluster is deployed to a network with NSG rules in place to restrict traffic.  If you add Ingress resources to the cluster you will need to add NSG rules to allow inbound traffic.
