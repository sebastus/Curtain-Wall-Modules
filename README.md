# What is Curtain Wall?

Curtain Wall is a lightweight framework produced by Microsoft for provisioning resources in Azure with Terraform. It focuses on the provisioning of private self-managed Azure resources for the creation of DevSecOps platforms and work-flows. It is comprised of a set of reusable Terraform modules designed to be used together, that stand-up different services and capabilities, and helps integrate them with Azure DevOps.

Curtain Wall is intended to make it easy to on-board new users to working with Terraform rather than abstracting them away from it. The modular service-oriented structure enables software factory infrastructure designs to be modelled in terms of their architecture, rather than at a low level. The modules provide a simple common interface for provisioning resources and services, and help ensure required security and operations tooling are consistently and correctly installed and configured. The modules can be stored remotely in Git and reused by multiple Terraform configurations.

# How to get started

First you need to set up a new Terraform environment. Use the module `blank-env-copy-me` for this in the following way:

1. Copy/paste the template folder and rename it to the new environment name.
   In powershell, this is: `cp .\blank-env-copy-me\ c:\whatever\newenv -Recurse`
   
2. Confirm the values in the dev.tfvars for this new environment.

NOTE: ensure that dev.tfvars in the new env is *not* committed to source control.

Once this is done use the Python codegen module to write necessary code into this environment. It uses environment variables populate details needed by the code generator. Set them as below:

```
$env:CURTAIN_WALL_MODULES_HOME = "C:\{path}\Curtain-Wall-Modules"
$env:CURTAIN_WALL_ENVIRONMENT = "C:\Users\{user}\{path for wherever your new environment is}"
$env:CURTAIN_WALL_BACKEND_KEY = "example"
```

To create a new set of resources, at the Curtain Wall Modules level run:

`python codegen/src/main.py create -g {resource group name}`


You can then add other modules to your environment with the command:

`python codegen/src/main.py add -m {module you want to add} -g {resource group name}`

# Running the Terraform

Change the appropriate variables in your tfvars file to reflect your azdo org and connections etc.

Then run:

`terraform init`
`terraform plan with -var-file=dev.tfvars and -out my.tfplan`
`terraform apply my.tfplan`

Running these three commands should populate your Azure Portal with a resource group containing:

- Key vault
- Log analytics workspace
- Managed identity
- Virtual networks
- Network security groups
- Network interface
- Disk
 
 and the modules you added.
